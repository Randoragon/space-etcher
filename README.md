# Space Etcher

## WORK IN PROGRESS

This game is in very early stages of development, it is not ready to be played yet.

---

Space Etcher is a game project I started to learn the ropes of SDL2.
The aim of the game is to provide a good real-time action-puzzle experience with
focus on speed, great mobility and a wide array of player abilities. The game should
offer a lot of content due to its complexity, while remaining feather-weight, running
fast and using system resources sparingly.

## Dependencies

- [SDL2](https://libsdl.org)
- [RND\_Game](https://github.com/randoragon/randoutils/tree/master/c-libs/game)

## Installation

Run the following (if necessary, as root):

    make install

The executable will be copied to `/usr/local/bin/space-etcher`.
